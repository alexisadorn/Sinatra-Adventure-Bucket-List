# Adventure Bucket List
![](/public/img/SinatraApp.jpg)

Adventure Bucket List is an app that lets you keep track of all the adventures and travels you want to go on in your life.

Creating a profile and logging in to the app allows you to keep track of your personal bucket list.

You can add new experiences you want to have before you kick the bucket and make changes to your existing experiences. You can even see what others have added to their lists to get inspiration for yours!

Adventure Bucket List was created for the Flatiron School's Online Web Development Program using Sinatra. The formatting of the app was created using Bootstrap.

For more information on how to use the app, see my video walkthrough!
